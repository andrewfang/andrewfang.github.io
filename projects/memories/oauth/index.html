  <h2>User data</h2>
  <p>Upon grating Memories (the application) access to your Google account, you agree to let the application read from your Google Photos library. Authentication into Google is used for the sole purpose of displaying your photos in the application's widget. The application does not use any user data including, but not limited to, name, phone number, email. Photo data is requested on demand and not stored beyond the duration that the widget displays it.</p>

	<h2>Enhacing user functionality</h2>
  <p>The application allows you to use Google services to improve functionality so that you may see your photos from Google Photos. The choice to authenticate with Google is that of the user and is not a requirement to use the application.</p>
