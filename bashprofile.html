            <h3>Setting up your .bash_profile</h3>
            <p>A .bash_profile (or .bashrc) is run at terminal startup and is used to create a set of preferences for your terminal to run under. To set up your very own .bash_profile, just go to your home directory and check to see if there is already a .bash_profile created:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd $HOME
$ ls -a</code></pre>
            <p>Now, look through the contents of your home directory and if a .bash_profile already exists, you're good to go.  Otherwise, just open up a new file using the text-editor of your preference and create a plaintext document with the filename ".bash_profile", saved in your home directory (where ever "cd $HOME" takes you.)</p>

            <h3>Things to put in your .bash_profile</h3>
            <p>There are so many interesting and cool things you can put in your .bash_profile.  If you look through Google, you can find some pretty good examples.  I'll just put some of my favorites here. A "#" means that a comment follows on the line and its text will not be interpreted. For all the following, just write or copy the code into a newline of your .bash_profile.  To see the changes, you'll have to run:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd $HOME
$ source .bash_profile</code></pre>
            <p>This will make sure your .bash_profile is refreshed and reloaded.  Alternatively, you can close your terminal and reopen it, and that will have the same effect.   Also, running: </p>
<pre><code>$ cd </code></pre>
            <p>Is the same as </p>
<pre><code>$ cd $HOME</code></pre>
            <p>And:</p>
<pre><code>$ . .bash_profile </code></pre>
            <p>Is equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>$ source .bash_profile </code></pre>
            <p>Which means that you can write a simplified version by doing:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd
$ . .bash_profile</code></pre>
            <p>Either way, just make sure you're in the same directory as your .bash_profile, and then source it to see the changes you've recently made.</p>

            <h3>Alias-ing</h3>
            <p>An alias is like a nickname. By declaring an alias, we create a new command that the terminal will be able to understand and interpret.  The syntax is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>alias newcommand='thingtorun'</code></pre>
            <p>So, newcommand will be the command that we wish to run, maybe a simplified version of a very long, commonly used command.  This long, commonly used command (thingtorun) that we don't want to keep typing in over and over again will go inside the single quotes. This is handy when you run some command with the same inputs and flags over and over again.  You can simply alias that command with another shorter name and run that instead.</p>
            <p>--------</p>
            <h3>Colored ls</h3>
            <p>This change to the unix command "ls" will make the directories colored and have a "/" after them. Also, the output will be multi-columnar.</p>
<pre><code># Colored ls with marked directories and multi-columnar output
alias ls='ls -pGC'</code></pre>

            <h3>Interactive remove</h3>
            <p>I like this change to "rm" so that I don't accidentally delete files.  Whenever I want to remove something, it confirms with me that I really DO want to delete it before doing so. The noclobber option makes sure I don't overwrite another file by saving or naming something under that same name.</p>
<pre><code># Make rm interactive, confirm every remove for safety
alias rm='rm -i'
set -o noclobber</code></pre>

            <h3>Going up directories</h3>
            <p>I find that I go up directories very often.  Usually, we would type "cd .." to go up a directory.  But a simple alias can shorten this even more:</p>
<pre><code># type ".." to go up one directory
alias ..="cd .."</code></pre>

            <h3>Changing to a specific directory</h3>
            <p>We all have folders that we go to very often.  Mines happens to be hidden deep beneath layers and layers of other directories.  So why not just use an alias that solves this problem?</p>
<pre><code># goes to my Berkeley directory that I often use
alias cdberk="cd Documents/Berkeley/Year2/Semester1/CS/code"</code></pre>

            <h3>Colored ManPages</h3>
            <p>Man pages are great when I have no idea what a command does in Unix.  But it's quite boring in color, so I found a quick hack that presents my man pages with the color schemes I use in Vim.  **Note your vim colors should be set up before this will work.</p>
<pre><code># Use vim's color scheme in man pages
export MANPAGER="col -b | /usr/share/vim/vim73/macros/less.sh -c 'set ft=man nomod nolist' -"</code></pre>

            <h3>Faster SCP</h3>
            <p>When I'm working on projects, I tend to scp a lot of stuff.  This function will take in 2 or 3 arguments.  The first argument will be the file I want to transfer.  The second argument will be the account you want to scp it to.  The optional third argument will be the server you want to send it through.  My default is hive8.cs but you can change it however you see fit.</p>
<pre><code># a faster scp function
fscp () {
  username=cs61c-aa
  server=hive8.cs
  if [ $2 = '61c' ]; then
  username=cs61c-aa
  fi
  if [ $2 = '170' ]; then
  username=cs170-aa
  fi
  if [ $3 ]; then
  server=$3
  fi

  scp -r $1 $username@server.berkeley.edu:~/proj/proj4
}</code></pre>
            <p>If I want to send file.java to my 61c account:</p>
<pre><code>fscp file.java 61c</pre></code>
            <p>If I want to send file.java to my 61c account using hive22.cs, then I would type:</p>
<pre><code>fscp file.java 61c hive22.cs</pre></code>


            <h3>Glookup from home</h3>
            <p>Say you want to look up your grade for your CS class. You have to log onto the school server, then run the `glookup` command, right?  What if you could do it from your home terminal?  Credits to Soumya Basu for inspiring this.</p>
<pre><code># glookup function
glookup () {
  if [ $1 = '61c' ]; then
  username=cs61c-aa
  fi

  if [ $1 = '170' ]; then
  username=cs170-aa
  fi

  if [ $2 ]; then
    ssh $username@hive8.cs.berkeley.edu "glookup -s Total"
  else
    ssh $username@hive8.cs.berkeley.edu 'glookup'
  fi
}</code></pre>
            <p>To look up my grades for my 170 class:</p>
<pre><code>glookup 170</pre></code>
            <p>To look up my grade compared to others for my 170 class:</p>
<pre><code>glookup 170 all</pre></code>

            <h3>Make new Tex homework files from a template</h3>
            <p>For CS170, we have weekly problem sets and I type them up in Latex.  I got tired of making a new Latex document everytime, so I created a template document that had a pre-created header, where I replaced each homework number with the words "REPLACEME".  I saved this file deep in my documents and then, whenever I wanted to create a new homework, I used this function to make a new Latex document pop up on my desktop. </p>
<pre><code># creates 170 hw file
make170() {
  sed "s/REPLACEME/$1/g" $HOME/Documents/Berkeley/Year2/Semester1/CS/code/170hw-Template.tex > $HOME/desktop/hw$1.tex
}</code></pre>
          <p>To create a template for homework 23:</p>
<pre><code>make170 23</pre></code>
