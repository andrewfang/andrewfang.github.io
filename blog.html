        <!-- Here are all of my blog entries for the development of the website.-->
        <section class="main_content" id="devblog">
          <h3>The Dev Blog</h3>
            <p>Everything you would ever want to know about the development of this website.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a class="blogdates" href="#" id="current">July 2013</a></li>
          <div class="blogentry">
            <h5>Sixteenth of July</h5>
              <p>I decided to move my blog today.  Now, what used to be my blog is this Development Blog, where I will talk about the changes that are being made to my website.  This will allow for an actual blog to be formed sometime in the future.  I will keep all the blog content in a separate blog.html file, and then link my index.html#blog to the correct internal anchor of the blog.html file.  There's so much potential and so much I could do, but I've only got so many hours in a day.  We'll see what I can do!</p>

            <h5>Fifteenth of July</h5>
              <p>I have some new ideas!  I looked on my friends' webpages and there's a thing or two that I can learn from them.  So to start things off, I succesfully implmented some internal link anchoring so that andrewbfang.com/#about actually sends the user to the about page.  I also took the liberty of disabling the nav button of the current page so users can't reload the same page. AND there's a fun little gem in my 404.  In the coming days, I plan to fix some Firefox and IE incompatibilities that I'm still having issues with.  I'd also like to build a XML sitemap.  In other news, the Google Student Blog published an article about Android Camp today.  Hear a first hand account of my experience <a href="http://googleforstudents.blogspot.com/2013/07/android-camp-2013-not-your-typical.html">here</a>!</p>
          
            <h5>Fourteenth of July</h5>
              <p>I published my first app on the Play Store today!  It is a magic 8 ball that I worked on last winter break.  It was my first time playing around with Android development and it went quite well.  When school started, I put it on the backburner.  After Android Camp, this passion to make apps was rekindled and I really wanted to publish an app on the store.  So, I fixed some bugs, generated a signed APK file, and then registered to be an Android Dev.  This is the culmination of my hard work.  Get it <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewbfang.magic8">here</a>!</p>
          
            <h5>Fourth of July</h5>
              <p>Happy Independence Day! In honor of this joyous occasion, I fixed the custom 404 page that shows up when you go to a bad link. For now, that is all... Off to enjoy my day outdoors in the blistering 104 heat.</p>
          </div>
          <li><a class="blogdates" href="#">June 2013</a></li>
          <div class="blogentry">
            <h5>Thirtieth of June</h5>
              <p>I wanted to add a feature where anyone can email me directly straight from the website so I started looking into how to do this.  I added the form, inputs, and animations for this feature but I haven't implemented the actual functionality yet. Soon...!</p>
            <h5>Twenty-Ninth of June</h5>
              <p>I tested my website on different browsers and I found out that Internet Explorer doesn't render JQuery at all.  So until I find a better fix, I'm going to put a message on my home screen that only shows up when the user uses an incompatible browser.  Also, I finally figured out how to put two div elements on top of each other!  With this, I successfully put background images for all of my projects.  Then, I found out about transitions and the magic that they can do, so I implemented that into the project page and the about me page.</p>
            <h5>Twenty-Seventh of June</h5>
              <p>Today, I went to an offsite adventure with the RAW DLP team at Symantec.  We went to Dillon Beach and had a fun-filled day of team-bonding exercises and activities.  I came back home tired and hungry, but somehow found the time to work a little more on this website. I added a fun little animation to my picture in the about page and a secret easter egg on the home page.  See if you can find it!</p>
              
            <h5>Twenty-Sixth of June</h5>
              <p>It's been such a long time since I've had the time to sit down and work on this website.  Well, mostly because I was trying to come up with something new that I could do.  Today, I taught myself JQuery and I've been so amazed at all the animations that it allows for.  It's so cool that I spent this entire afternoon and night reworking this very website so that it is now one extended HTML document instead of 5 different ones.  Instead of sending you to different pages, the buttons now implement JQuery functions that show and hide the material.  At this point, I am still amazed at what JQuery can do.  More changes to come! </p>

            <h5>Sixth of June</h5>
              <p>More progress made today! Today, I got my domain to redirect correctly so that my andrewbfang.com URL correctly maps to GitHub Pages, where I host the page.  And then I played around with JavaScript in order to get this blog to display nicely.  Note that the months are clickable, so that you can show and hide the blog posts from different months.</p>

            <h5>Fifth of June</h5>
              <p>Finally I have time to start the real work on this website.  I have spent the past few hours working on the icon that shows up next to the website URL(in Safari) or on the tab (in Chrome).  It's actually just a 16x16 square grid of pixels that I filled in one by one on <a href="http://favicon.cc">favicon.cc</a>.  I went through 5 different colors and a couple of different line thicknesses and designs before I finally settled on the current one. I sure hope it renders properly. </p>

          <h5>Twenty-Eighth of May</h5>
            <p>First day of work!  I am officially a Software Engineering Intern at Symantec, working on the Data Loss Prevention product in the San Francisco office. This is my first summer internship and I am very excited for a fun summer full of learning.  I plan to contribute to my team with all my energy and passion and hopefully learn a lot in the process. </p>

        <!-- Here is the section that appears when you navigate to bash_profile information from the Blog. -->
        <section class="main_content" id="bash">
            <h3>Setting up your .bash_profile</h3>
            <p>A .bash_profile (or .bashrc) is run at terminal startup and is used to create a set of preferences for your terminal to run under. To set up your very own .bash_profile, just go to your home directory and check to see if there is already a .bash_profile created:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd $HOME
$ ls -a</code></pre>
            <p>Now, look through the contents of your home directory and if a .bash_profile already exists, you're good to go.  Otherwise, just open up a new file using the text-editor of your preference and create a plaintext document with the filename ".bash_profile", saved in your home directory (where ever "cd $HOME" takes you.)</p>

            <h3>Things to put in your .bash_profile</h3>
            <p>There are so many interesting and cool things you can put in your .bash_profile.  If you look through Google, you can find some pretty good examples.  I'll just put some of my favorites here. A "#" means that a comment follows on the line and its text will not be interpreted. For all the following, just write or copy the code into a newline of your .bash_profile.  To see the changes, you'll have to run:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd $HOME
$ source .bash_profile</code></pre>
            <p>This will make sure your .bash_profile is refreshed and reloaded.  Alternatively, you can close your terminal and reopen it, and that will have the same effect.   Also, running: </p>
<pre><code>$ cd </code></pre>
            <p>Is the same as </p>
<pre><code>$ cd $HOME</code></pre>
            <p>And:</p>
<pre><code>$ . .bash_profile </code></pre>
            <p>Is equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>$ source .bash_profile </code></pre>
            <p>Which means that you can write a simplified version by doing:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd
$ . .bash_profile</code></pre>
            <p>Either way, just make sure you're in the same directory as your .bash_profile, and then source it to see the changes you've recently made.</p>

            <h3>Alias-ing</h3>
            <p>An alias is like a nickname. By declaring an alias, we create a new command that the terminal will be able to understand and interpret.  The syntax is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>alias newcommand='thingtorun'</code></pre>
            <p>So, newcommand will be the command that we wish to run, maybe a simplified version of a very long, commonly used command.  This long, commonly used command (thingtorun) that we don't want to keep typing in over and over again will go inside the single quotes. This is handy when you run some command with the same inputs and flags over and over again.  You can simply alias that command with another shorter name and run that instead.</p>
            <p>--------</p>
            <h3>Colored ls</h3>
            <p>This change to the unix command "ls" will make the directories colored and have a "/" after them. Also, the output will be multi-columnar.</p>
<pre><code># Colored ls with marked directories and multi-columnar output
alias ls='ls -pGC'</code></pre>

            <h3>Interactive remove</h3>
            <p>I like this change to "rm" so that I don't accidentally delete files.  Whenever I want to remove something, it confirms with me that I really DO want to delete it before doing so. The noclobber option makes sure I don't overwrite another file by saving or naming something under that same name.</p>
<pre><code># Make rm interactive, confirm every remove for safety
alias rm='rm -i'
set -o noclobber</code></pre>

            <h3>Going up directories</h3>
            <p>I find that I go up directories very often.  Usually, we would type "cd .." to go up a directory.  But a simple alias can shorten this even more:</p>
<pre><code># type ".." to go up one directory
alias ..="cd .."</code></pre>

            <h3>Changing to a specific directory</h3>
            <p>We all have folders that we go to very often.  Mines happens to be hidden deep beneath layers and layers of other directories.  So why not just use an alias that solves this problem?</p>
<pre><code># goes to my Berkeley directory that I often use
alias cdberk="cd Documents/Berkeley/Year2/Semester1/CS/code"</code></pre>

            <h3>Colored ManPages</h3>
            <p>Man pages are great when I have no idea what a command does in Unix.  But it's quite boring in color, so I found a quick hack that presents my man pages with the color schemes I use in Vim.  **Note your vim colors should be set up before this will work.</p>
<pre><code># Use vim's color scheme in man pages
export MANPAGER="col -b | /usr/share/vim/vim73/macros/less.sh -c 'set ft=man nomod nolist' -"</code></pre>

            <h3>Faster SCP</h3>
            <p>When I'm working on projects, I tend to scp a lot of stuff.  This function will take in 2 or 3 arguments.  The first argument will be the file I want to transfer.  The second argument will be the account you want to scp it to.  The optional third argument will be the server you want to send it through.  My default is hive8.cs but you can change it however you see fit.</p>
<pre><code># a faster scp function
fscp () {
  username=cs61c-aa
  server=hive8.cs
  if [ $2 = '61c' ]; then
  username=cs61c-aa
  fi
  if [ $2 = '170' ]; then
  username=cs170-aa
  fi
  if [ $3 ]; then
  server=$3
  fi

  scp -r $1 $username@server.berkeley.edu:~/proj/proj4
}</code></pre>
            <p>If I want to send file.java to my 61c account:</p>
<pre><code>fscp file.java 61c</pre></code>
            <p>If I want to send file.java to my 61c account using hive22.cs, then I would type:</p>
<pre><code>fscp file.java 61c hive22.cs</pre></code>


            <h3>Glookup from home</h3>
            <p>Say you want to look up your grade for your CS class. You have to log onto the school server, then run the `glookup` command, right?  What if you could do it from your home terminal?  Credits to Soumya Basu for inspiring this.</p>
<pre><code># glookup function
glookup () {
  if [ $1 = '61c' ]; then
  username=cs61c-aa
  fi

  if [ $1 = '170' ]; then
  username=cs170-aa
  fi

  if [ $2 ]; then
    ssh $username@hive8.cs.berkeley.edu "glookup -s Total"
  else
    ssh $username@hive8.cs.berkeley.edu 'glookup'
  fi
}</code></pre>
            <p>To look up my grades for my 170 class:</p>
<pre><code>glookup 170</pre></code>
            <p>To look up my grade compared to others for my 170 class:</p>
<pre><code>glookup 170 all</pre></code>

            <h3>Make new Tex homework files from a template</h3>
            <p>For CS170, we have weekly problem sets and I type them up in Latex.  I got tired of making a new Latex document everytime, so I created a template document that had a pre-created header, where I replaced each homework number with the words "REPLACEME".  I saved this file deep in my documents and then, whenever I wanted to create a new homework, I used this function to make a new Latex document pop up on my desktop. </p>
<pre><code># creates 170 hw file
make170() {
  sed "s/REPLACEME/$1/g" $HOME/Documents/Berkeley/Year2/Semester1/CS/code/170hw-Template.tex > $HOME/desktop/hw$1.tex
}</code></pre>
          <p>To create a template for homework 23:</p>
<pre><code>make170 23</pre></code>
