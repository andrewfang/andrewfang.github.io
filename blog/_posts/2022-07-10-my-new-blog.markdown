This blog series is a new journey in which I will document do-it-yourself projects that I have taken on. I will do my best to document each venture with the materials and time needed. Most of these projects should require no prior knowledge, and many are a result of me scouring the depths of Google to find solutions to my unique problems.

At first, I will be able to write more frequently, as I have a backlog of adventures that have been undocumented. After that, we'll have to see what life throws at me.

Hope you find these useful and inspiring!
